# hello-world

Greetings Humans! 

This is my first repository, or what I understand as first coding here in GitHub, hence the "hello-world". 
I wonder why the words they use here are different... As expected, you need to have a common sense for you to take a step forward or else you will be stuck in a place from time to time.
